# Brain-Tumor-Identification-and-Detection-Using-ML
This project is “Brain Tumor Detection” and is made by using 
the KNIME Analytic Platform as the base for creating this 
helpful project. It is made by using Machine Learning 
Algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks etc. Mainly 
it’s successful by using Transfer Learning.

We got an accuracy of nearly 71.1%, as the data input 
given are images of MRI scan, the model can identify who has 
tumors and who doesn’t also different types of possible tumor 
occurrences and this is very helpful for society.
