Data Collection for Training and Testing of Model: 

Brain Tumors are complex. There are many abnormalities in 
the size and location of the brain tumor(s). This makes it 
really difficult to completely understand the nature of the 
tumor.

I collected data from Kaggle, below are the references of 
websites:
